#!   MARKDOWN_USAGE="##Introduction&#10;JSON-stat is a simple lightweight JSON dissemination format best suited for data visualization, mobile apps or open data initiatives, that has been designed for all kinds of disseminators.&#10;&#10;JSON-stat also proposes an HTML microdata schema to enrich HTML tables and put the JSON-stat vocabulary in the browser.&#10;&#10;You can find more about JSON-stat [here](https://json-stat.org/).&#10;&#10;EUROSTAT is exposing its data into this format and this custom transformer is specifically designed to retrieve data from Eurostat. &#10;&#10;###How to use this transformer?&#10;&#10;A fixed list is  inserted inside the transformer and the dataset code is displayed at the end of the title [xxxx]. Many don&apos;t need parameters but you will find some that require to reduce the number of categories.&#10;&#10;On the [Eurostat website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/browse-statistics-by-theme) you can browse for the data your interest. The dataset code is stated in (xxxx) after the title.&#10;&#10;To reduce the number of categories browse to Eurostat [REST API builder](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/json-and-unicode-web-services/getting-started/query-builder) and paste the dataset code.&#10;&#10;This website will help you navigating through all the options available. At the end you will receive a URL that you can copy-paste in this custom transformer.&#10;&#10;###Input parameters&#10;&#10;**Eurostat end point URL** : &#10;Fixed part of the URL, This is default set to Eurostat&apos;s REST API end point.&#10;&#10;**Dataset reference**:&#10;The last part of the REST URL that changes for every dataset. This is the part you can copy/paste from the Eurostat website. You can also use the drop down and select a full dataset. In some cases this might not give you any results and you will be expected to reduce the number of categories.&#10;&#10;**Attributes to expose**:&#10;The attributes  you want to see in the FME Workspace. The prefilled attributes are usualy included in every dataflow but you can remove them if wished so. Browse inside the Feature information window to see what fields are available and add them here.&#10;&#10;###Example&#10;_hlth_hlye?precision=1&amp;unit=YR&amp;unitLabel=code_&#10;&#10;Returns you &quot;Healthy life years (from 2004 onwards)&quot; and that was about 5346 records in April 2020.&#10;&#10;__hlth_hlye_&#10;Would give you the same as above but the precision, unit and unitLabel will be Eurostat defaultsettings.&#10;&#10;Copy paste this part of the url inside the &quot;Dataset reference&quot; and run the transformer. Go into the inspector and evaluate the returned attributes.  Each dataset has its own unique attribute information. Simply add the hidden once in the &quot;Expose attribute&quot; list and your done.&#10;&#10;The Eurostat tool is does not asure that you get a result back. This might mean that your query is too detailed filtered. In such case an error would be returned...&#10;&#10;###More info&#10;&#10;There is a lof of additional info such as meta data and descriptions for every attribute geven. These can all be found in the &lt;Schema&gt; transformer output.&#10;&#10;Every parameter (or dimension) has a  list of available attributes and a description. All this is stored inside lists in FME.
